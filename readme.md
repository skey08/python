I hear python being mentioned all the time but I didn't know anything about it,
so this was a good time to start getting a basic understanding.

Python is an object oriented programing language that is said to be very easy to
read and understand, and consequently easier to learn.  It allows you to write
fewer lines of code.

It is comparable to Perl, Ruby, Schema or Java.  It is often used with the framework Django.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and now owned/maintained by Microsoft and Google.

I like the little bit I learned experimenting with python.  It did seem fairly easy to read and
understand.  One cool aspect of it was being able to import modules.

I didn't really encounter and hurdles just yet but I read that it can be slow, and doesn't
have much of a presence on mobile or client side apps.

The resource I used was Codecademy.  It seemed pretty useful.  I only got through a few hours of the 13hrs of tutorials that they offer.

Python comes installed with OSX Yosemite or higher, or you can do $ brew install python
Then clone this repo and CD into the python folder.  In your terminal type "python app.py" or "python pigLatin.py" to run one of the two apps I created.
